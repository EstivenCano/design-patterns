# Facade Pattern

The **Facade pattern** provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes or APIs. It acts as a higher-level interface that encapsulates the underlying complexity, making it easier to use and understand. It promotes loose coupling between components and improves code readability and maintainability.

You can take a quick look at how to use this pattern in React with functional components in the following example:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { API } from "api-library";

// API Facade for simplified API interactions
const APIFacade = {
  getUserData: async (userId: string) => {
    try {
      const userData = await API.getUser(userId);
      // Process and return the simplified user data
      return {
        id: userData.id,
        name: userData.name,
        email: userData.email,
      };
    } catch (error) {
      throw new Error("Failed to fetch user data.");
    }
  },
  // Other simplified API methods...
};

const UserProfile: React.FC<{ userId: string }> = ({ userId }) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(true);
  const [userData, setUserData] = React.useState<any>(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUserData = async () => {
      try {
        const simplifiedUserData = await APIFacade.getUserData(userId);
        setUserData(simplifiedUserData);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        // Handle error state
      }
    };

    fetchUserData();
  }, [userId]);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (!userData) {
    return <div>User not found.</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userData.name}</h1>
      <p>Email: {userData.email}</p>
      {/* Render additional user details */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
```

In this example, we have an APIFacade that acts as a simplified interface for interacting with the API. It provides a method getUserData that fetches user data for a given userId and returns a simplified version of the data. The UserProfile component utilizes the APIFacade to fetch and display the user's name and email. It handles loading and error states, and provides a clean and simplified interface for interacting with the API.

### Use cases

Some common use cases for the Facade pattern include simplifying component composition and configuration, abstracting data fetching and state management, and integrating with third-party libraries or services. It promotes code readability, reduces dependencies, and enhances the maintainability of the application by encapsulating complex logic behind a simplified and unified interface. Whether it's composing complex UI components, managing application state, or interacting with external services, the Facade pattern can be a valuable tool in simplifying and abstracting the underlying complexities in React, TypeScript, and functional component applications. Here are some use cases of how to use it:

#### 1. Simplifying Complex APIs:

The Facade pattern is useful when working with complex APIs or libraries that have multiple layers or intricate configurations. It can provide a simplified interface that hides the complexity and exposes only the necessary methods or functionalities.

Example in React and TypeScript:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { ComplexAPI } from "complex-api-library";

// Facade for ComplexAPI
const ApiFacade = {
  fetchData: async () => {
    const complexApi = new ComplexAPI();
    const data = await complexApi.fetchData();
    // Process and return the simplified data
    return data.map((item) => ({ id: item.id, name: item.name }));
  },
  // Other simplified methods...
};

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState([]);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const simplifiedData = await ApiFacade.fetchData();
      setData(simplifiedData);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render the simplified data */}
      {data.map((item) => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### 2. Component Composition and Configuration:

The Facade pattern can be used to simplify the composition and configuration of complex components or component hierarchies. It provides a unified interface for creating and configuring components, hiding the details of their internal structure.

Example in React and TypeScript:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { Button, TextField, Checkbox } from "ui-library";

// UI Facade for simplified component composition
const UIFacade = {
  renderForm: () => (
    <form>
      <TextField label='Name' />
      <TextField label='Email' />
      <Checkbox label='Subscribe to Newsletter' />
      <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  ),
  // Other simplified component compositions...
};

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render a simplified form */}
      {UIFacade.renderForm()}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### 3. Third-Party Library Integration:

The Facade pattern can be used to integrate with third-party libraries or services, providing a simplified interface that aligns with the application's needs. It abstracts away the complexities of the underlying library, making it easier to use and maintain.

Example in React and TypeScript:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { ThirdPartyAnalytics } from "analytics-library";

// Analytics Facade for simplified tracking and event handling
const AnalyticsFacade = {
  trackEvent: (eventName: string, data: Record<string, any>) => {
    ThirdPartyAnalytics.track(eventName, data);
  },
  // Other simplified tracking and event handling methods...
};

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    AnalyticsFacade.trackEvent("ButtonClicked", { buttonId: "submit" });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Track Button Click</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Advantages

- Simplifies complex systems and APIs, making them easier to use.
- Provides a clear and concise interface, improving code readability.
- Encapsulates implementation details, promoting loose coupling.
- Facilitates maintenance and refactoring by hiding complex internals.

### Disadvantages

- May introduce an additional layer of abstraction, which can add complexity if not properly designed.
- Overuse of the Facade pattern can lead to an overly complex facade object that tries to do too much.
- The Facade pattern can hide important details or customizations of the underlying system, limiting flexibility in some scenarios.
